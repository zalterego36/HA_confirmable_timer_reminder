# HA_confirmable_timer_reminder
Confirmable Timer - Tracks the number of days since a task was last done.  Lets you trigger a confirmation prompt ("Have you done the task?") from a button, automation, etc.  If the user answers Yes, the timer is reset. If No, nothing happens.  Sends an optional reminder notification after a threshold number of days.
